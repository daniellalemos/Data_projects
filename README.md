# Data Science and Analysis Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Science and Analysis Repository. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring various facets of data science and analysis like data visualization, machine and deep learning algorithms, or SQL.

## Summary

This repository encompasses a range of projects and resources aimed at reinforcing the fundamentals of data science and analysis. From exploring sales insights using Power BI to implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, each section offers practical applications and learning opportunities.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

### Machine Learning
  - Fundamental concepts of machine learning and a diverse range of projects that actively employ these concepts.
  - `Cross-validation`, `Decision trees`, `Ensemble methods`, `Gradient descent`, `Hyperparameter tuning`, `K-means clustering`, `K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)`, `Lasso and Ridge regression`, `Linear regression`, `Logistic regression`, `Naive Bayes`, `One-hot encoding`, `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`, `Random Forest` and `Support Vector Machines (SVM)`.

### Deep Learning
  - Basic fundamental concepts of deep learning.
  - Project focused on classifying handwritten digits.
  - Project focused on classifying clothes images.
  - Project focused on classifying customer churn.

### Data Analysis
  -  Project that gives valuable insights into a company's sales using Power BI.

### SQL
  - Analyse of a movies database using SQL queries.

### Statistics
  -  Project: Analysis of health insurance data.
  -  Project: Gene expression signature of cigarette smoking and its role in lung adenocarcinoma development and survival.

### ETL
  - Data engineering project.
    - Created an ETL pipeline. Parallelized tasks.
    - Used airflow on AWS EC2 and AWS RDS Postgres instance database.
   
### MongoDB
- MongoDB Data Management and Analysis Script
    - Database Interaction: Python script connects to MongoDB, performs schema validation, inserts data, and executes queries.
    - Schema Validation: Defines rules for 'book' and 'author' collections, ensuring data consistency.
    - Query Functions: Enables retrieval of specific book titles, author-book relationships, and book count per author, supporting basic data analysis.
